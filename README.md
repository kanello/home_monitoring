## Fun proj

This will run on raspberry pi in the apartment. Goal is to collect consistent data on "things" and then do "stuff" with it.

- is my ISP providing their promised service?
- how much does the temperature in my apartment vary during the day?
- what's affecting the quality of my sleep?

### Check-off when complete (and notes when otherwise)

- [x] proto-Docker installation
- [ ] run on Raspberry Pi
- [ ] schedule `loader.py` to run
- [ ] add basic flask front end to run speed test charts

#### Notes

- for now, backup the database on GitHub
